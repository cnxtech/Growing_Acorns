# Growing Acorns
## Acorns Company Case Study


While Jeff Cruttenden was in college he realized that although many of his friends were interested in investing, some of them even studying finance and economics, very few had investment portfolios.  This sparked an idea: what if there was a way to help people, especially college students, open small investment accounts?  Jeff grew up learning about investing from his father, Walter Cruttenden, who had founded multiple businesses.  So when Jeff approached his father with the idea, Walter considered how technology was drastically bringing down the price of trading, and recognized an opportunity.  

The two quickly started brainstorming ideas about micro-investing and a mobile app that could act as an investing platform for the college student to 30 something demographic, which according to the U.S. Census Bureau is around 112 million people.  The end result was the creation of Acorns, a novel app that links to a user’s debit/credit card, rounds up every purchase to the nearest dollar, then invests the remaining change in a low-cost, diversified portfolio of exchange traded funds (ETF).  Father and son team Walter and Jeff Cruttenden incorporated Acorns in 2012, making it the first fintech startup to introduce the innovative round-up technology.  Acorns has since raised $257 million in funding over ten rounds from investors including PayPal, Comcast Ventures, BlackRock and NBCUniversal as well as various celebrities and athletes, giving it a valuation of $860 million in 2020. 

The company continues to add more automated services in an effort to give its users an affordable and simple tool to support their financial wellness.  For $1 a month Acorns automatically moves extra change from debit and credit card purchases into an investment portfolio of low-cost index ETFs.  Investments are made into one of five portfolios which are diversified across asset classes to maximize returns based on a user’s selected level of risk, a theory developed by Acorns advisory board member Dr. Harry Markowitz.  For $3 a month the user gets access to Acorns Later, which is an IRA selected by the company based on the user’s financial profile.  This subscription tier also offers Acorns Spend, a FDIC protected checking account and debit card, allowing for real-time round-ups, no minimum balance or overdraft fees and unlimited free or fee-reimbursed ATM withdrawals.  For $5 a month they add Acorns Early, which is an opportunity for parents to make automatic investments into portfolios set up for their children.  The company also offers Acorns Earn, where over 200 partner brands will kick in a percentage of purchases to a user's investment account.  And finally, there is Acorns Grow, a free financial literacy platform intended to educate users on budgeting, saving, and debt, as well as other relevant financial topics.  

All of these services are built around the company’s mission to teach financial literacy and provide Americans with simple tools to save and invest, all in an effort to close the country’s financial wealth gap.  It is reported that more than 66% of Americans can’t pass a basic financial literacy test.  Acorns is determined to rectify this by helping its users have a more meaningful experience with not just its brand, but the entire financial industry.  More recently, with the pandemic intensifying the importance in having an emergency fund, Acorn hopes that the app will make it easier for Americans to save for future adversity.  

Acorns is one of many apps in the personal finance domain that utilize technology to help people invest in a better future.  One trend that has been made popular in the last decade is micro-investing.  Acorns uses this strategy by investing in super small increments and buying fractions of shares so people can start investing with as little as a few dollars.  Another trend among personal finance apps is automated round-up technology, which allows fintech companies to round-up purchases to the nearest dollar and put that change into a savings account or micro-invest it.     

Automation along with robo-advising are major technological innovations that have allowed personal finance apps to help people easily invest at a fraction of the cost of traditional financial services.  Robo-advisors are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithm-driven investment services that involve minimal human supervision.  Throw in a little artificial intelligence and machine learning and suddenly consumers can input some of their data into an app and have a robo-advisor provide investment strategies or tips for saving and budgeting in minutes.  Consumers who once felt they didn’t have the money or knowledge to have an investment portfolio or savings account have the tools and technology they need at their fingertips.      

Acorns utilizes industry leading standards across their technology stack.  For their front-end website, Acorns uses Javascript, React Javascript framework, and the Polymer Javascript library.  They also employ Bootstrap for HTML/CSS framework and D3 for visualizations like charts and graphs.  Their databases are comprised of PostgreSQL and Redis for quick lookups in memory.  The hosting structure seems to be primarily AWS: Amazon S3 for data storage, Amazon EC2 for servers and computation, and Amazon CloudFront for CDN.  Back-end languages include Ruby with Ruby on Rails framework, Scala applications, and Apache Spark for data analysis.  For mobile development, Acorns uses Kotlin for Android apps and Swift for iOS.  They also use GitHub for version control, Travis for continuous integration and Docker for containerization.  Finally, Acorns utilizes New Relic for monitoring and performance.      

Although Acorns is widely recognized as the original round-up app, similar companies have sprouted up in the wake of Acorns success.  Round-up mobile banking apps like Chime, Qapital and Digit offer similar products pointed to the same demographic, but are geared towards boosting savings accounts rather than building investment portfolios and IRAs.  It could be argued that the mobile app Robinhood is a competitor since it is a very popular investment app that boasts zero-fee accounts and no trading fees.  However, Robinhood is strictly a trading app that doesn’t offer much in terms of extensive guidance and education resources.  

The most comparable threat to Acorns is Stash since it also operates within the domain of personal finance and offers many of the same investment services, both approaching all-in-one financial tools.  Acorns and Stash are “robo-advisor meets automated saving tool meets app”, both emphasizing ease of use as much as tools and performance.  What differentiates Acorns is a stronger advisor component that builds a portfolio based on user’s preferences and lower-cost funds.  Acorns simply offers more, and while the advisor’s costs may be higher for features like Acorns Later, portfolio management is imperative to an investor’s success over time.

From a business perspective, Acorns is doing slightly better than Stash.  Stash, a newer company founded in 2015, has around 300 employees and serves 5 million customers with $1.8 billion in assets under management.  Acorns currently has close to 350 employees and serves 8.2 million customers with over $3 billion in assets under management.  Although both companies are private and not required to disclose annual revenue, varied sources report Acorns revenue between $70 and $100 million while Stash is closer to $50 million.

The big question is, what’s next for Acorns?  At first I was thinking Acorns should expand their ecosystem to offer savings accounts, so users can save and invest all in one place.  Although this feature would put them in direct competition with the banking fintech companies I mentioned previously, I can’t seem to find one that does both savings and investments.  The idea is also in line with Acorns’ mission to help Americans financially with an all-in-one tool.  It also doesn’t seem like much of a jump since Acorns already offers debit/checking account services via partner Lincoln Savings Bank.  But then I thought, why not take it one step further?  Maybe Acorns could be the first app to offer tailored financial advice.  A digital service that takes into account a client’s holistic financial situation, gives tailored financial recommendations and provides simple tools to achieve financial well-being--without ever having to leave the house. 

The pandemic has people around the world experiencing unexpected hardships.  People have lost loved ones, businesses are closing and unemployment rates have skyrocketed, resulting in many struggling financially.  It would be huge if there was an app that advised people if it was best for them to save or pay back debt or invest, then offer an easy way to do as advised.  Furthermore, the pandemic has pushed older generations to take advantage of fintech services rather than go out in public.  This creates an opportunity to target a new demographic that is traditionally wary of technology and show them how they can benefit from a simple all-in-one financial tool.  This demographic is also the most at risk and scared people do unreasonable things, especially with their money.  Tailored financial advice might help them feel safer in perlious times.  There is so much uncertainty right now, people are scared and they need help.  However I do foresee a few hurdles.

Obviously there has to be an established level of trust with the client for them to give Acorns all of their personal financial data.  I’m sure there are also regulatory issues surrounding this idea.  Furthermore, the technology would have to be advanced.  However, it shouldn't be too far outside Acorns' core competency since they already have robo-advising technology for investment strategies.  It must be possible to utilize the same aspects of machine learning and artificial intelligence to take robo-advising to the next level.  Acorns is already partnered with Plaid, and since a big part of this would be data aggregation, perhaps the companies can find the solution together.  If Acorns truly empathizes and wants to help people in these troubled times, I think they should do it by addressing individual needs with tailored financial services, this is how they make a difference.
